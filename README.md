# Cloud_MultiClassification_NeuralNetwork

This project focuses on building a neural network model for the multi-class classification of cloud types using meteorological data. The process begins with thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling features, followed by the design and training of a neural network to distinguish between various cloud categories. Emphasis is placed on evaluating model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to ensure robust classification results. I documented the entire workflow in a Jupyter Notebook, incorporating visualizations that illustrate both the data characteristics and the modelâ€™s learning behavior. This project highlights the application of deep learning in atmospheric data analysis and serves as a foundation for further experimentation in environmental machine learning tasks.
